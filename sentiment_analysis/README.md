## About this Reference Application

In this Amazon Transcribe & Comprehend reference Application, we make use of [Streaming feature](https://www.plivo.com/docs/voice/api/stream/). Plivoâ€™s audio streaming resource lets you receive raw audio input over WebSocket (wss or ws) URLs from live phone calls in near real time.

In this reference application, we expose a websocket which receives raw audio streams from live phone calls. Once the call is hung up, this application receives a hangup callback and then pushes the raw audio file to S3 to fetch the transcripts and sentiment scores.
